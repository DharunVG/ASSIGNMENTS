# ASSIGNMENTS

1. **shortest distance.java:**
              
              Distance between two points is the length of the line segment that connects the two given points. Distance between two points in coordinate geometry can be calculated by finding the length of the line segment joining the given coordinates.This is been provided with an optimized code.
              
              
2. **optimized prime number code.java**

                The best optimised way to find a prime number is by factorisation method.it is optimised due to use of only 1 for loop.
                
3. **num 7 star generation code.java **

                This code is optimized to print a star using number 7. For which the input the size is is mentioned by me.
